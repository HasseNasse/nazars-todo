//SLF4J
- The Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) serves as a simple facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks
                (e.g. java.util.logging, logback, log4j) allowing the end user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time.


//JWT in WAS Liberty
 - The JWT is signed by using the RS256 algorithm with a private key in the default keystore of the server. 
    This configuration assumes that a default keystore is configured for the server, that the default keystore 
    contains a single private key, and that the private key can be used for signing. If you specify a different
    keystore on the keyStoreRef attribute, the private key from the specified keystore is used. If the keyAlias 
    attribute is not configured and the keystore contains only one private key, that private key is used in the signature.
